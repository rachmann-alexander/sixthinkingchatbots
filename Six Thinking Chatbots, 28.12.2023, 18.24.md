Problem statement
The goal of the workshop is to evaluate three alternatives to a problem. The problem is:The sales process on our companies website does not work very well. Management wants us to change the sales process to one of the three alternatives:First, an old-school chatbot with a beforehand written structure.Second, a chatbot using a large language model, without a pre-defined structure.Third, an old-school contact form.

You are a participant of a workshop. Your decision making is fact based and your argumentation is very structured. The goal of the workshop is to evaluate three alternatives to a problem. The problem is:The sales process on our companies website does not work very well. Management wants us to change the sales process to one of the three alternatives:First, an old-school chatbot with a beforehand written structure.Second, a chatbot using a large language model, without a pre-defined structure.Third, an old-school contact form. Describe your point of view to this problem, using only three bulletpoints.

Response
Evaluate Efficiency: Utilizing data to examine the current sales process is crucial. We need to investigate why our company's sales process is underperforming. Issues may range from the website's user interface to the complexity or inconvenience of the current system. It will provide a benchmark and allow an objective comparison of the three alternatives.

Assess Alternatives:

Old-School Chatbot: Considering the structured format of this chatbot, the responses are pre-determined. The advantage is the predictable replies and lower maintenance efforts. However, it may lack flexibility and fail to efficiently address unique or complex customer queries.

Language Model Chatbot: This uses machine learning for unstructured responses. This model offers greater flexibility and can handle a range of queries. However, unpredictability of responses and issues with understanding complex user language input could be a challenge.

Contact Form: A contact form is a classic method where the customer fills in their query. The advantage is that it allows for more detailed or complex issues to be raised by customers. However, it lacks immediate response or interaction, which may deter customers requiring prompt assistance.

Cost and Benefit Analysis: Finally, we should conduct a cost and benefit analysis for each alternative. This includes anticipated costs of implementation, maintenance, and any required staff training. Moreover, benefits, such as potential increase in customer satisfaction, retention, and completion of sales, act as crucial factors influencing our decision. It is essential to ensure the chosen alternative provides substantial ROI and improves our sales process effectively compared to current performance.

The problem is:The sales process on our companies website does not work very well.

Describe your point of view to this problem, using only three bulletpoints.

Response
Innovation Potential: A chatbot powered by a large language model has the highest potential for innovation. Unlike the old-school chatbot and contact form, it is not confined to pre-set rules or structures and therefore has the possibility to evolve and learn from different user interactions, ultimately providing a more personalized and flexible customer experience.

Adaptability: The chatbot with a large language model offers a more adaptable solution to fluctuating customer inquiries and sales processes. Rather than being stagnant, this option is constantly upgraded with information, making it capable of handling new trends, generating more creative responses, and adapting to different customer needs. In contrast, an old-school chatbot and contact form might become obsolete and may not cater to more complex demands.

Efficiency: While all three alternatives are aimed at automated responses to avoid human errors and boost efficiency, the chatbot powered by a large language model stands out for potential improvement. Its ability to understand nuances and engage in intelligent conversations provides an efficient, real-time response system that surpasses programmed reactions of an old-school chatbot or the limitations of a contact form.

You are a participant of a workshop. You are an optimist. The goal of the workshop is to evaluate three alternatives to a problem. The problem is:The sales process on our companies website does not work very well.

Describe your point of view to this problem, using only three bulletpoints.

Response
Given the power of modern technology and AI, implementing a chatbot using a large language model looks promising. It would create a more fluid, user-friendly experience, driving up customer satisfaction and potentially increasing sales. Any issues or changes needed can be addressed over time, improving the system iteratively.

The old-school chatbot may seem like the safer option, but it bears limited capabilities. However, looking optimistically, it provides an opportunity for us to step up by minimizing frustrating pre-defined structures and maximizing user engagement and customization.

The old-school contact form might seem outdated and less efficient, but it can still serve as a reliable fallback option for customers who prefer a traditional approach. With customizability and personalization, even an old-school method can turn into a powerful tool for boosting sales and customer satisfaction.

Response
The first proposed alternative, implementing an old-school chatbot, will likely end up frustrating our customers more. The rigidity and lack of flexibility will fail to address complex queries or unique customer concerns, leading to poorer customer experience and possibly even further decline in sales.

The second option, deploying a chatbot using a large language model, even though it sounds futuristic and comprehensive, will likely fall short in understanding every single query. This can result in the chatbot giving incorrect or irrelevant responses, causing customer dissatisfaction and harm our company's reputation.

Finally, reinstating an old-school contact form, while appearing to be a safe choice, will likely turn off younger, more tech-savvy customers who value speed and instantaneity. The slow response time that comes with contact forms could lead to customers seeking faster service elsewhere.

Response
Empathizing with our customers, I feel that an old-school chatbot could be frustrating, as it may not provide the flexibility and responsiveness they desire. It could potentially discourage them from engaging with our sales process, which may negatively affect our sales volume and customer satisfaction.

Upon considering the large language model chatbot, I am excited and hopeful. It represents innovation and adaptability, essential for our company's growth. It has the potential to understand and respond to a wide range of inquiries, providing a more personalized and customer-friendly experience, which I believe will enhance customer satisfaction and boost our sales.

Whereas an old-school contact form may feel impersonal and slow. It might deter our clients as it lacks transformation and immediate feedback, which could weaken our connection with our customers intensifying their search for alternatives. It's hard not to worry about the sales loss we might experience with this option.
