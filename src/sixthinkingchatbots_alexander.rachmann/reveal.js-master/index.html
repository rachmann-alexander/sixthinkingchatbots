The problem is: The sales process on our companies website does not work very well. Management wants us to change the sales process to one of the three alternatives: First, an old-school chatbot with a beforehand written structure. Second, a chatbot using a large language model, without a pre-defined structure. Third, an old-school contact form. </p></section><section><h2>White Hat </h2><img class="reveal" src="img/whitehat.png" alt="White Hat" /><p>1. Old-school chatbot with pre-defined structure: While this option may seem straightforward and easy to implement, it lacks the ability to adapt to customer inquiries effectively. The pre-defined structure may limit the chatbot's responses, potentially leading to customer frustration and a suboptimal user experience.

2. Chatbot using a large language model: This alternative offers a more flexible and adaptable solution, as it can learn from and respond to a wide range of customer inquiries. However, it requires significant investment in training and maintenance to ensure the chatbot provides accurate and helpful responses.

3. Old-school contact form: This traditional method may be simple and cost-effective, but it lacks the real-time interaction and immediate response that customers expect in today's digital age. This could result in slower response times and a less engaging user experience, potentially leading to lost sales opportunities.

In conclusion, while all three alternatives have their merits, the most effective solution would likely be the chatbot using a large language model, as it offers the flexibility and adaptability necessary to provide a high-quality customer experience. However, it is crucial to invest in training and maintenance to ensure the chatbot delivers accurate and helpful responses.</p></section><section><h2>Green Hat </h2><img class="reveal" src="img/greenhat.png" alt="Green Hat" /><p>1.
