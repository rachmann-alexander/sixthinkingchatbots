## Problem statement
The goal of the workshop is to evaluate three alternatives to a problem. The problem is: The sales process on our companies website does not work very well. Management wants us to change the sales process to one of the three alternatives: First, an old-school chatbot with a beforehand written structure. Second, a chatbot using a large language model, without a pre-defined structure. Third, an old-school contact form.

Second, a chatbot using a large language model, without a pre-defined structure. Third, an old-school contact form.  Describe your point of view to this problem, using only three bulletpoints. 
### Response
1. Factual Analysis: When it comes to improving the sales process, it is important to base the decision on concrete data and facts. Studying the current performance of our website sales process can provide insights into where the problems lie. These could be in the areas of user interface, customer interaction, lack of personalized engagement, or response speed. A deep understanding of these problems will lead to a more informed decision. 

2. Objective Comparison: Each of these three alternatives comes with its own merits and demerits. An old-school chatbot with a pre-defined structure may offer a direct and concise solution but may lack flexibility and intuitiveness. A large language model chatbot can provide dynamic interaction, but might be costlier and require more resources. An old-school contact form, while assuredly simpler and potentially less intimidating for some users, might not offer the proactive engagement that chatbots do. Nonetheless, each of these options would affect customer experience, resource allocation, and overall business performance.

3. Long-Term Impact and Scalability: In addition to the immediate fixes, it is vital to consider the long-term implications of our choice. Scalability, adaptability to evolving market trends, and potential future problems should be factored in. For example, while a predefined chatbot might work perfectly now with the current queries, will it scale and adapt as we grow and diversification happens? Or will an AI model remain relevant and be cost-effective in the long run? Also, how each strategy impacts the larger company vision and brand perception is crucial.

### Response
1. Innovation & AI-Driven: Given our ultimate goal is to enhance sales, the large language model chatbot represents a major innovation with the potential to drastically improve client interaction. Unlike the old-school chatbot, this model adjusts to client needs on the fly, providing more tailored and efficient service.
   
2. Enhanced User Experience: The large language model not only helps in resolving queries but can also recommend products according to the user's requirement which overall enhances the customer experience, potentially driving sales up.

3. Limitation of Alternatives: While an old-school chatbot and contact form may potentially be simpler to implement, they lack flexibility and personalization. They are bound by the predefined structure and cannot adapt to unique customer queries or recommend products, limiting their effectiveness in improving the sales process.

### Response
1. Emphasize Innovation: A chatbot using a large language model, without a pre-defined structure, represents a forward-thinking and innovative approach. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning have significant potential for enhancing customer experiences, allowing us to real-time and tailored solutions leading to improved customer satisfaction and sales increases. 

2. Adaptability: While an old-school chatbot with beforehand written structure and an old-school contact form may seem reliable, they lack adaptability which is essential in today's rapidly evolving digital markets. Flexible problem-solving capacity of the AI chatbot can cater to a broader variety of customer queries, ensuring every client feels heard and their unique needs are adequately addressed. 

3. Potential for Growth: The AI chatbot presents an opportunity for growth and improvement over time, as machine learning algorithms can adapt and become more efficient with more customer interactions. This holds potential for an ever-improving sales process, a unique competitive advantage, and sustainability in the marketplace.

### Response
1. None of the proposed alternatives seem to offer a comprehensive solution. An old-school chatbot can appear impersonal and rigid, frustrating customers who may have complex inquiries. It is unlikely to be equipped to handle the diverse range of queries, ultimately leading to user dissatisfaction and further sales reduction.
  
2. A language model chatbot, although flexible, can also cause a slew of issues. Whilst it could understand and respond to a variety of queries, its absence of a pre-determined structure can lead to confusion, inconsistency, and potentially, misleading information. Its inability to maintain a uniform tone might impact our brand adversely. Technical glitches, which are probable, could degrade the customer experience further.

3. As for the old-school contact form, it is woefully outdated and too slow in today's fast-paced digital world. Customers tend to avoid such systems due to their long processing times. Our sales process would still be lacking without immediate feedback to customer queries. Plus, there's a risk of a build-up in customer service requests that can lead to longer response times, making our company appear unresponsive or negligent.

### Response
1. Emotionally, I can resonate more with the interaction provided by chatbots. This could make customers feel more attended to, potentially enhancing their buying experience and could lead to increased sales. Given the options, I'd naturally go with a chatbot solution.

2. Capturing the emotional essence of the issue, I gravitate towards the large language model chatbot. This type of chatbot can learn from interactions over time, thus offering a more personalized and enhanced customer experience. It could potentially understand and evoke positive emotions in customers, making them more inclined to finalize the purchase.

3. The thought of an old-school contact form does not inspire emotions of efficiency and effectiveness to me. It might feel outdated and slow, potentially putting off customers rather than facilitating sales. It's important that customers feel their time is valued; hence, I believe opting for either of the chatbot solutions would be a better choice.

### Response
After analyzing all of these contributions, it appears that the majority lean towards investing in a large language model chatbot for the company. Those in favor of this option highlighted several benefits including its adaptability to changing customer needs, the potential for learning and improvement over time, and the ability to provide tailored, efficient service on the fly. They also lauded its innovative approach and the potential for the drastically improved client interaction it could offer. 

It's recommended to consider the concerns raised by the pessimist too, ensuring to mitigate potential issues like consistency, the maintenance of brand tone, and avoiding technical glitches. Availability of resources, cost implications and consideration for the long-term impact are also factors that should be taken into account when implementing a large language model chatbot solution.

The participants showed less enthusiasm for the old-school chatbot and the contact form, identifying limitations like lack of flexibility and evolution, impersonal service, slow turnaround, and inability to handle complex inquiries. These options could result in a process that may feel outdated and inefficient, potentially deterring customers rather than facilitating sales and improving the customer experience. 

Therefore, based on these contributions, the large language model chatbot stands out as the most promising alternative.
