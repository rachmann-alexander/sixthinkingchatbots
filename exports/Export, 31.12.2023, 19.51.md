The goal of the workshop is to evaluate three alternatives to a problem. The problem is: The sales process on our companies website does not work very well. Management wants us to change the sales process to one of the three alternatives: First, an old-school chatbot with a beforehand written structure. Second, a chatbot using a large language model, without a pre-defined structure. Third, an old-school contact form.  Describe your point of view to this problem, using only three bulletpoints. 
### Response
1. Efficacy: From a problem-solving perspective, deploying a chatbot using a large language model might be our best bet, keeping in mind it is versatile, can handle dynamic interactions, and likely to present a better user experience compared to a statically structured chatbot or a traditional contact form. This should more effectively resolve customer queries and complaints, drawing on its vast dataset for problem-solving, and therefore enhance the sales process.

2. Data Analysis: Using a large language model-equipped chatbot can provide real-time analytics and insights, like peak inquiry times and common user problems. These can be utilized for continuous process refinement and addressing potential areas of improvement in the sales process. This stands in contrast with an old-school chatbot or a traditional form which both lack real-time analytics capabilities.

3. Cost and Time Efficiency: Despite an initial investment on its development, a large language model chatbot will save on long-term customer service costs, as it wonâ€™t require constant updates or human intervention as much. Moreover, it can provide 24/7 customer service. An old-school chatbot, on the other hand, would require regular script updates to stay relevant, and the traditional form method might be slower and more labor-intensive.

### Response
1. Innovation Potential: A language model chatbot is the most innovative choice, with possible significant benefits in customization, user engagement, and efficiency. Unlike the other options, it has the ability to adapt to user's requirements and learn from past exchanges, providing a more personalized and intuitive user experience.

2. User Experience: While an old-school chatbot provides a structured approach, it can be rigid and limiting, failing to address complex inquiries. Contact forms are often ignored by the users and may lead to longer response times. Whereas a large language model chatbot can mimic human-like conversation, ensuring swift and efficient responses effectively improving the user experience and engagement.

3. Future-Proof Solution: The language model chatbot is also more future-forward when considering improvements in AI technology. It has greater capacity for evolution and adjustment in response to changing needs or issues. This could give our business a competitive advantage and avoid the need for continued significant changes.

### Response
1. Embracing Optimism in Technology: Given the continued advancements in AI and machine learning, I strongly believe that choosing a chatbot that uses a large language model, though might appear challenging initially, would grant us a significant competitive advantage in the long run. It is equipped to deliver more nuanced, personalized, and dynamic customer interactions, which underscores the importance of empathy in sales today.

2. Empowering Customer Experience: Rather than sticking to a conventional and limited approach with old-school chatbots and contact forms, the large language model offers an interactive conversation and mimics human-like responses. It's one step further to fostering a seamless online experience that could potentially result in higher customer satisfaction, thereby increasing sales.

3. Forward-Thinking Approach: As optimists, we should anticipate future trends and continue innovating. The adoption of a sophisticated chatbot reflects our company's commitment to grow, be flexible and adaptable. This decision could also open up opportunities for us to explore and innovate new solutions to issues we may encounter in the future.

### Response
1. Each option in its own way is fraught with its own set of problems. An old-school chatbot with a pre-written structure might not seem genuine to users and could lead to frustration if it can't answer queries outside the designed path. 

2. Implementing a chatbot with a large language model and no predefined structure, on the other hand, sounds chaotic. This may lead to a lack of clarity and consistency in presenting information and could further confuse or mislead clients even more. 

3. The third alternative of using an old-school contact form might drive customers away due to the lack of instantaneous responses. Our digital world demands speed and convenience, and the lag in response could result in lost sales opportunities.

### Response
1. I would support the second option to implement a chatbot that uses a large language model. It creates a more dynamic and interactive experience for our customers, which I believe is invaluable in promoting positive feelings towards our sales process.

2. I emphatically feel that the old-school chatbot might not provide the level of sophistication expected by our customers. It lacks the ability to understand customers' needs in real-time, potentially leading to frustration and dropping sales - which would be disappointing and damaging to our brand.

3. Although an old-school contact form is a safe choice, it doesn't inspire me with excitement and I fear it might be perceived as impersonal and outdated by our customers. In today's fast-paced e-commerce environment, we need to create a connection with our customers, and I don't believe a contact form can provide that. I strongly feel we need to innovate and move forward with the times.
