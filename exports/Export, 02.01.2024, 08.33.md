## Problem statement
The goal of the workshop is to evaluate three alternatives to a problem. The problem is: The sales process on our companies website does not work very well. Management wants us to change the sales process to one of the three alternatives: First, an old-school chatbot with a beforehand written structure. Second, a chatbot using a large language model, without a pre-defined structure. Third, an old-school contact form.

The goal of the workshop is to evaluate three alternatives to a problem. The problem is: The sales process on our companies website does not work very well. Management wants us to change the sales process to one of the three alternatives: First, an old-school chatbot with a beforehand written structure. Second, a chatbot using a large language model, without a pre-defined structure. Third, an old-school contact form.  Describe your point of view to this problem, using only three bulletpoints. 
### Response
1. Feasibility and Success Rates: The first consideration should be the practicality and success rate of the sales process among the three alternatives. An old-school chatbot with pre-defined structure might be easy to implement and manage, however, its rigidity could harm the user experience and thus lower the conversion rates. On the other hand, a language model chatbot can provide an improved customer experience by dynamically responding to end users, but its implementation can be tricky and demands substantial control over language model usage, which the company might not possess.

2. Cost-Effectiveness: The second point to evaluate is the cost-effectiveness of each alternative. We need to balance the costs related to development, implementation, and potential ongoing maintenance of each system against the predicted increases in sales and customer satisfaction. The old-school chatbot and contact form can be cheaper options initially, yet may not drive as much growth as the AI chatbot, which though costlier at the outset, potentially yields higher long-term returns.

3. Consumer Engagement: The final consideration should be the engagement level of the customers. The engagement directly impacts potential conversion rates. An old-school contact form might put off users due to its static, one-way communication nature. An AI chatbot could engage visitors more interactively and personally, holding them interested enough to continue the sales process, which can critically influence the sales outcomes.

### Response
1. I would lean towards the second option - a chatbot using a large language model. This innovative approach is adaptable to specific customer queries, thus providing a more personalized experience. It can understand and respond intelligently to user queries, reducing the need for human intervention.

2. The old-school chatbot (option one) relies on pre-written structures which can hinder its capacity to handle all the varied and complex queries of users. The chatbot with the large language model can understand context and nuances better, leading to improved customer satisfaction.

3. The old-school contact form (option three) can be perceived as outdated in this era of instant communication and could potentially reduce the user experience. Customer engagement could be drastically improved with the use of AI-driven chatbots that can interact and respond in real-time.

### Response
1. The AI chatbot: Embracing technology, an AI chatbot will provide a dynamic and personalized experience for every user. Leveraging AI would enable continuous learning and adaptation to customer queries, driving improved sales conversions over time. It may take time to implement and perfect, but the potential benefits outweigh the initial challenges.

2. Direct Customer Interaction: The old-school chatbot provides a sturdy, predetermined framework that simplifies customer queries and speeds up the process. It provides consistency in responses and can be utilised effectively with some improvements, such as enhancing the conversation flow or adding more possible responses to match various customer needs. 

3. Tradition that Works: Although it might seem behind the times compared to chatbot technology, traditional contact forms are a tried-and-true method, providing customers with a sense of authenticity and personal engagement. Proper modifications and usage can certainly yield useful results and increase sales, making it a viable alternative.

### Response
1. All three options have serious downsides. The old-school chatbot, while simple to implement, lacks the dynamism and adaptability needed to appropriately address complex customer issues leading to even more frustration.
   
2. The large language model chatbot may sound like a cutting-edge solution but it comes with the risk of incorrect responses and misunderstandings due to its lack of pre-defined structure, which can further worsen the already broken sales process.
   
3. The old-school contact form can be viewed as outdated and impersonal by our customers. It also removes any real-time support functionality which could delay the sales process, thereby impacting the company's profits negatively.

### Response
1. Upon an emotional analysis, I connect deeply with the application of a chatbot using a large language model, as it, metaphorically speaking, adds warmth and fluidity in the interaction process with the potential customers. Its unstructured nature allows for more human-like engagement, making customers feel heard and understood, which elevates their buying experience.

2. The old-school chatbot with a pre-defined script can seem to lack empathy and may fail to connect to customers on a more personalized level. Engaging with it might leave the customers unfulfilled, as its inability to understand their unique concerns could feel less satisfactory.

3. Finally, using the old-school contact form might seem mundane and stiff. It does not offer any immediate support or interaction to the customers, which, based on my emotional take, could create a sense of disconnect. It lacks the touch of warmth needed to cater to customers' needs immediately.

### Response
From a neutral point of view, the Insights gathered from each participant shed light on distinct dimensions of the problem.

The fact-oriented participant emphasized practicality, cost-effectiveness, and customer engagement. According to them, while a structured old-school chatbot might be easier to implement, it lacks the flexibility that a language model chatbot offers. However, while the language model chatbot might provide an improved customer-browsing experience, it might be more challenging to implement effectively due to potentially lacking the level of control over the language model. Conclusively, they hinted that the cost and effectiveness of all the alternatives must be balanced to derive the best solution.

The emotion-oriented participant heavily favored the AI chatbot in terms of emotional connection, arguing that it adds a level of warmth and understanding to customer interaction. They believed that old-school chatbots and contact forms can be perceived as impersonal and fail to engage customers on an emotional level.

The pessimistic participant touched upon the potential downsides of all alternatives, highlighting issues in understanding complex customer queries with chatbots and the outdated perception of contact forms.

The optimistic participant highlighted the potential positives of all three, accounting for the responsive ability of the AI chatbot, the consistency of old-school chatbots, and the authenticity of contact forms.

Finally, the innovation-focused participant leaned towards the AI chatbot as the most innovative and adaptable solution and criticized the potential lack of modernity in the other alternatives.

Balancing the views presented, it appears that the language model chatbot represents a potentially valuable answer to the sales process problem. Despite potential implementation challenges and predictive control, it might provide superior customer engagement, a personalized experience, and potential for long-term growth in sales. The participants, especially the emotion and innovation-oriented, highlighted that the language model chatbot could offer a more human-like interaction, leading to a better buying experience. 

So, with a consensus leaning towards chatbot solution using a large language model, this alternative should then be seriously considered as the choice of change in the sales process on the company's website.
